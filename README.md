## User Experience

### Project Goals

The goal of this project is to provide a service to track issues with software, either individually or on a team. Users will be able to create accounts, log in, store details of their issues and update
the issues as required.

### User Goals

* Create bug reports and track them to resolution.
* Update bug reports.
* A visually appealing and straightforward design.
* A fully responsive service that operates the same across all devices.
* Have an overview of currently reported issues or historical data.

### Site Owner Goals

* Provide users with a service to track their software issues and generate revenue from paid version/ subscription.
* Generate revenue with advertising space targeted at software teams since this is the target audience.


### User Stories:

* "I need a way to track issues for projects that I was working on. Notepad or sticky notes are just cluttered and often deleted or impossible to find" - John
* "I always think that you should let someone try a product before they buy it. It just makes it easier for everyone to get what they want" - Deborah
* "On a website you want to make sure that you only have the options you need - you don't want it cluttered up with hundreds of buttons you don't understand let alone use" - Victor

### User Requirements and Expectations

These days internet shopping is more common than ever - yet as people become more familiar with it they also become more cautious and savvy with their purchases.
Therefore providing the best UX, proper authentication and using secure payment gateways (in this case Stripe) is necessary to offer the best solution.

#### User Requirements

* Interact with a visually appealling and intuitive website.
* Navigate with ease on any device.
* Quickly grap the basic function and controls of the website and service.
* Choose the version you wish to use (Free, Trial or Paid) and purchase it quickly and easily.
* Create new bug reports and add them to the database.
* Update bugs with a few clicks.
* Can reach out to the developer as required.


#### User Expectations

* Safe storage of any details provided.
* No payment information stored - once the transaction is completed the business has no need to store the user's payment information.
* Service can be used across any device with no drop in functionality.
* Easy and intuitive navigation.

## Design

As this is targeted at the technology sector the colour scheme is based on a 'Dark Mode' colour palate since this is common and preferred in this sector and is also prevelant in the imagery of
technology. The colour scheme was taken from coolers.co and is currently as follows (TBC):
